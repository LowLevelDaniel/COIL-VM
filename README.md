# COIL Virtual Machine
A simple COIL Virtual Machine which instead of copmiling .coil / .cof to native .ncof it directly interprets the instructions and executes in a virtual machine like environment similar to java and python. Currently being built to support version 1.0.0 as the COIL specification evolves so will this Virtual Machine.

This is not directly intended for production but is a simple way for copmiler developers targeting COIL to ensure that the COIL they generate is valid.
